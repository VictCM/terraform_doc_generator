# python_doc_gen

.docx document generator based on Python providing info about a deployment via the .tfstate. For this we can already have the .tfstate (state file of a Terraform deployment) or use Terraformer to get this (to be implemented)

Generator has two four parts atm:
 - resource_parser.py: It takes the .tfstate and parse it to get the info of the deployment, after that it sends that information to the graph_file_generator.py and doc_gen.py
 - graph_file_generator.py: It receives the info from resource_parser.py and create a YAML file that data to be send to a docker what creates a .png topology with the nodes and networks of the deployment
 - doc_gen.py: This can be used with two purposes, one is to generate documentation abour the resources and add the topology .png generated on the docker service and/or remplace words from a existent .docx
 - dld4e-headless: A docker that consume our .yaml template generated by graph_file_generator.py and give us a .png with the topology we have built.
 
 ## Usage
 
 Firstly, we have to instantiate the docker with 
 
 ```docker run -p 3030:3030 bonndan/dld4e-headless:latest```
 
 and then we can execute 
 
 ``` sudo python3 ./resource_parser.py -i openstack_example.json``` 
 
 to build the new .docx documentation based on the terraform .tfstate that would be saved on tests/demo.docx
